# Search Strategy and Selection Criteria for Implementation Best Practices

This document outlines the **search strategy**, **inclusion criteria**, and **exclusion criteria** used to identify and select relevant literature for summarizing implementation best practices for reusable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates.

## 1. Search Strategy

To comprehensively identify implementation best practices for reusable IaC templates, we conducted a multivocal review encompassing both academic and grey literature. The search strategy included the following steps:

### 1.1. Information Sources

- **Academic Databases:**
  - IEEE Xplore
  - ACM Digital Library
  - SpringerLink
  - ScienceDirect

- **Grey Literature Sources:**
  - Whitepapers from authoritive organizations (e.g., CNCF, AWS, Azure)
  - Industry reports from organizations like Gartner and Forrester
  - Tool documentation and official guides (e.g., Terraform, Helm)

### 1.2. Search Keywords

We used a combination of keywords and phrases to capture relevant literature:

- **Primary Keywords:**
  - "Infrastructure as Code"
  - "IaC best practices"
  - "Reusable IaC templates"
  - "Terraform best practices"

- **Secondary Keywords:**
  - "Cloud-native infrastructure"
  - "IaC template development"
  - "DevOps automation"
  - "IaC modularity"
  - "IaC scalability"

### 1.3. Search Process

1. **Initial Search:**
   - Conducted keyword searches across all identified information sources.
   - Utilized advanced search features to filter results by relevance and publication date (last 10 years).

2. **Screening Titles and Abstracts:**
   - Reviewed titles and abstracts to assess relevance to reusable IaC template development.

3. **Full-Text Review:**
   - Retrieved and reviewed full texts of shortlisted documents to evaluate their suitability based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

4. **Snowball Sampling:**
   - Examined references of selected papers and documents to identify additional relevant literature.

## 2. Inclusion Criteria

Documents were included in the review if they met **all** the following criteria:

- **Relevance:**
  - Focused on implementation best practices for reusable IaC templates.
  - Addressed topics related to IaC development, deployment, scalability, modularity, and documentation.

- **Type of Literature:**
  - Scientific papers, peer-reviewed articles, and authoritative books.
  - Grey literature including whitepapers, industry reports, tool documentation, and reputable blog posts.

- **Actionable Insights:**
  - Provided clear, actionable best practices or guidelines applicable to IaC template development.

## 3. Exclusion Criteria

Documents were excluded from the review if they met **any** of the following criteria:

- **Irrelevance:**
  - Focused on general IaC concepts without specific best practices for reusable templates.
  - Addressed unrelated topics such as purely theoretical aspects of IaC without practical implementation guidance.

- **Type of Literature:**
  - Opinion pieces, editorials, or informal blog posts lacking authoritative backing.
  - Duplicate publications or multiple versions of the same document.

- **Language:**
  - Published in languages other than English.

- **Publication Date:**
  - Published before 2014, as older literature may not reflect current best practices and tool capabilities.

## 4. Selected Literature
