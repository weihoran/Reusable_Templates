# Search Strategy and Selection Criteria for Implementation Best Practices

This document outlines the **search strategy**, **inclusion criteria**, and **exclusion criteria** used to identify and select relevant literature for summarizing implementation best practices for reusable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates.

## 1. Search Strategy

To comprehensively identify implementation best practices for reusable IaC templates, we conducted a multivocal review encompassing both academic and grey literature. The search strategy included the following steps:

### 1.1. Information Sources

We utilized a variety of information sources to ensure a comprehensive review:

| **Category**          | **Sources**                                                                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Academic Databases**| IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect                        |
| **Grey Literature**   | Whitepapers from authoritative organizations (e.g., CNCF, AWS, Azure), Industry reports, Tool documentation and official guides (e.g., Terraform, Helm) |
                                       |
### 1.2. Search Keywords

We employed a combination of primary and secondary keywords to capture relevant literature:

| **Type**             | **Keywords/Phrases**                                                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Keywords** | "Infrastructure as Code", "IaC best practices", "Reusable IaC templates", "Terraform best practices", "Helm Chart best practices" |
| **Secondary Keywords** | "Cloud-native infrastructure", "IaC template development", "DevOps automation", "IaC modularity", "IaC scalability", "IaC documentation" |


### 1.3. Search Process

1. **Initial Search:**
   - Conducted keyword searches across all identified information sources.
   - Utilized advanced search features to filter results by relevance and publication date (last 10 years).

2. **Screening Titles and Abstracts:**
   - Reviewed titles and abstracts to assess relevance to reusable IaC template development.

3. **Full-Text Review:**
   - Retrieved and reviewed full texts of shortlisted documents to evaluate their suitability based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

4. **Snowball Sampling:**
   - Examined references of selected papers and documents to identify additional relevant literature.

## 2. Inclusion Criteria

Documents were included in the review if they met **all** the following criteria:

| **Criteria**            | **Description**                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relevance**           | Focused on implementation best practices for reusable IaC templates.                                                          |
| **Type of Literature**  | Scientific papers, peer-reviewed articles, authoritative books, grey literature including whitepapers, industry reports, tool documentation, and reputable blog posts. |
| **Actionable Insights** | Provided clear, actionable best practices or guidelines applicable to IaC template development.                                |

## 3. Exclusion Criteria

Documents were excluded from the review if they met **any** of the following criteria:

| **Criteria**            | **Description**                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Irrelevance**         | Focused on general IaC concepts without specific best practices for reusable templates or addressed unrelated topics.           |
| **Type of Literature**  | Opinion pieces, editorials, informal blog posts lacking authoritative backing, duplicate publications, or multiple versions of the same document. |
| **Language**            | Published in languages other than English.                                                                                     |
| **Publication Date**    | Published before 2014, as older literature may not reflect current best practices and tool capabilities.                       |
| **Lack of Actionable Content** | Provided high-level overviews without detailed best practices or implementation strategies.                                           |
